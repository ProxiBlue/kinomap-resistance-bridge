**Automatically control a non-smart exercise bike's resistance from any FTMS-compatible cycling app (Kinomap, MyWhoosh, Zwift, Rouvy, etc.)**

This project turns a dumb exercise bike into a smart trainer by emulating a Bluetooth FTMS (Fitness Machine Service) device on a Raspberry Pi. The app sends resistance/gradient commands, and the RPi converts them into physical button presses on the bike via relay-controlled GPIO pins. A speed sensor provides real telemetry back to the app.

## How It Works

```

    │  Exercise Bike   │
    │  +/- buttons     │
    │  flywheel        │
    └─────────────────┘
```

**The flow:**
1. Any FTMS app detects the RPi as a standard smart indoor bike
2. As terrain changes, the app sends inclination/resistance commands via BLE
3. The RPi calculates how many +/- button presses are needed
4. GPIO pins trigger relays that short the bike's button contacts, simulating presses
5. A speed sensor on the flywheel provides real speed, cadence, and distance data back to the app

## Features

- **Standard FTMS protocol** — works with any FTMS-compatible app (Kinomap, MyWhoosh, Zwift, Rouvy, TrainerRoad, etc.)
- **Real speed telemetry** — Hall effect sensor or tap into the bike's existing sensor for real speed, cadence, distance, and estimated power
- **Configurable resistance mapping** — calibrate inclination-to-resistance curves for your specific bike
- **Safety limits** — configurable min/max resistance, rate limiting on button presses
- **Modular design** — easy to adapt for different bikes and button configurations
- **3D printable case** — parametric OpenSCAD design for RPi + relay module enclosure

## Hardware Requirements

| Component | Purpose | Est. Cost (AUD) |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Raspberry Pi 3/4/Zero 2W | BLE + GPIO controller | $15-55 |
| 2-channel relay module (opto-isolated) | Button press simulation | $5-12 |
| A3144 Hall effect sensor | Speed/cadence sensing | $2-3 |
| Small magnet | Triggers sensor on flywheel | $0-2 |
| 10kΩ resistor | Pull-up for sensor signal | $0.10 |
| Dupont jumper wires (F-F) | RPi to relay connections | $3 |
| Hookup wire (22-26 AWG) | Relay to bike, sensor to RPi | $2 |
| **Total** | | **$30-80** |

> The speed sensor + magnet can be skipped if you tap into the bike's existing sensor instead. See [Tapping Existing Sensors](docs/tapping-existing-sensors.md).

## Software Requirements

- Raspberry Pi OS (Bullseye or later)
- Python 3.9+
- BlueZ 5.50+ (included in RPi OS)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lpetrolo/kinomap-resistance-bridge.git
cd kinomap-resistance-bridge
./scripts/setup_rpi.sh
```

### 2. Investigate your bike

Before wiring anything, investigate your bike's button circuit and existing sensors:
- [Button Investigation Guide](docs/hardware-investigation.md)
- [Tapping Existing Sensors](docs/tapping-existing-sensors.md) (if your bike has a digital display)

### 3. Build the hardware

Follow the [Build Guide](BUILD_GUIDE.md) for the complete parts list, wiring diagrams, and step-by-step assembly instructions.

### 4. Configure

```bash
cp config/default.yaml config/local.yaml
nano config/local.yaml
```

### 5. Test components individually

```bash
# Test relay/GPIO wiring (no bike connected)
python scripts/test_buttons.py

# Test speed sensor (spin flywheel by hand)
python scripts/test_speed_sensor.py

# Test BLE advertising (check with phone BLE scanner)
python scripts/scan_ble.py

# Test FTMS service in isolation
python -m src.ftms.ble_server --test
```

### 6. Run the bridge

```bash
python -m src.main
```

### 7. Connect your app

1. Open Kinomap / MyWhoosh / Zwift on your device
2. Go to device pairing / Bluetooth settings
3. Look for "RPi Resistance Bridge" (or your configured name)
4. Pair and start riding — resistance auto-adjusts with the terrain!

## Adapting for Other Bikes

This project is designed to be bike-agnostic. To adapt it for a different bike:

1. Investigate your bike's button circuit (see [hardware guide](docs/hardware-investigation.md))
2. Update `config/local.yaml` with your bike's resistance levels, button timing, and GPIO mapping
3. If your bike uses a different button mechanism (e.g., mechanical toggle, rotary dial), you may need to modify `src/gpio/button_simulator.py`
